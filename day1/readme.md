This is written in BASIC for the TRS 80 Model 100 Computer. 

The .TXT is provided in raw ASCII form, you will need to find a way to load it on to your machine or on to an emulator. It's also easier to read in normal text editors.

The .BA file is in BASIC format, and will probably be easier to load onto a Model 100.
